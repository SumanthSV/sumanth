## Backend Requirements

To fully enable the chatbot functionality, you need to set up a backend endpoint at `/api/chat` that:

1. Receives POST requests with user messages
2. Includes the professional persona as a system message
3. Calls the OpenAI ChatGPT API
4. Returns the AI response

### Example Backend Implementation (Node.js/Express)

```javascript
app.post('/api/chat', async (req, res) => {
  const { message, history } = req.body;
  
  const systemMessage = {
    role: "system",
    content: `You are Sumanth SV, an AI Engineer & Full-Stack Developer.
    [Include the full persona description here]`
  };
  
  const messages = [systemMessage, ...history, { role: "user", content: message }];
  
  try {
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages: messages,
      max_tokens: 500,
      temperature: 0.7,
    });
    
    res.json({ response: response.choices[0].message.content });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to get AI response' });
  }
});
```

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd portfolio-chatbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Set up backend** (required for chatbot functionality)
   - Create a backend server with `/api/chat` endpoint
   - Configure OpenAI API key securely
   - Include the professional persona in system messages

## Chatbot Features

### Voice Input
- Click the microphone button to start voice recognition
- Supports continuous speech recognition
- Visual feedback with pulse animation while recording
- Automatic text insertion when speech is detected

### Text-to-Speech
- Each bot message includes a "ðŸ”Š Speak" button
- Click to hear the response read aloud
- Toggle between play/stop functionality
- Uses browser's built-in speech synthesis

### Professional Persona
The chatbot is configured to respond as Sumanth SV with:
- First-person voice and professional tone
- Technical expertise in AI, web development, and cloud technologies
- Experience with real projects and hackathons
- Honest about learning areas while showing growth intent
- Focus on practical outcomes and real-world applications

## Mobile Responsiveness

The chatbot widget is fully responsive:
- Adapts to smaller screens
- Touch-friendly interface
- Optimized button sizes for mobile
- Proper spacing and typography scaling

## Browser Compatibility

## Customization

### Styling
- Modify `src/App.css` for custom animations
- Update Tailwind classes in components for design changes
- Adjust color schemes in the gradient classes

### Chatbot Behavior
- Update the persona in your backend `/api/chat` endpoint
- Modify typewriter speed in `useTypewriter.ts`
- Adjust speech recognition language in `useSpeechRecognition.ts`

## Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading of chat components
- Efficient re-renders with React hooks
- Optimized animations with Framer Motion
- Minimal bundle size with tree shaking

## Security Considerations

- OpenAI API key is kept server-side only
- Frontend communicates only with your backend
- No sensitive data stored in browser
- CORS properly configured for API endpoints
